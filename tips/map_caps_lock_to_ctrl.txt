No package is needed. Update the following config.

/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf:

Section "InputClass"
Identifier "system-keyboard"
Option "XkbOptions" "ctrl:nocaps"
EndSection


Don't use Xmodmap, because the config is reset every time connecting a new
device connected or waking up from suspend.
